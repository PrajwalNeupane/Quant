# Quant

This repository contains simulations and mathematical models relevant to quantitative finance and stochastic processes. It is an evolving project grounded in rigorous experimentation, curiosity, and play.

## ðŸ“ˆ Current Project: Random Walk Simulation

### `randwalk.ipynb`
Simulates a basic one-dimensional random walk to explore:
- Stochastic price modeling
- Effects of biased probabilities and step sizes
- Visualization of multiple paths and final value distributions

Inspired by simple coin-toss models of asset movement, this notebook is a stepping stone toward simulating Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), Monte Carlo option pricing, and other quantitative tools.

## ðŸ›  Planned Extensions
- GBM with drift and volatility
- Monte Carlo-based European option pricing
- Portfolio simulation with correlated assets
- Log return analysis and performance metrics

## ðŸ“š Background Concepts
- Random walks
- Brownian motion
- Geometric vs arithmetic means
- Stochastic differential equations

## ðŸ§ª Environment
Built with:
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ’¡ Author
Prajwal Neupane â€” undergraduate researcher in mathematics and philosophy, exploring the quantitative modeling of randomness in markets and minds.
